# WEPPcloud (web) user workflows

Use this reference when a WEPPcloud user wants help running a project in the web app and understanding what to download/share for interpretation.

## Minimal prompt to request from the user

Ask for:
- The WEPPcloud run URL(s) (paste from browser).
- A 1–2 sentence goal statement (what decision/question they’re answering).
- What differs between runs (if comparing).

## Running and troubleshooting (UI-agnostic)

- Verify the scenario definition matches the goal (area, land use/management, disturbance/treatments, climate inputs).
- If a run fails, ask for the exact error text and where it appears in the workflow.
- If a run “finishes” but results look empty, ask what result pages/exports are available and whether downloads contain zeros vs missing values.

## What to download/share for interpretation

Ask the user to export/download:
- Any outlet summary table (runoff/sediment at outlet).
- Any watershed water balance table (precip/runoff/ET/storage terms).
- If relevant: event-based table/hydrograph (peak flow, large storms).
- If comparing scenarios: the same artifacts for each run.
