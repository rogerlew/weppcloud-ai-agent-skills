# Outputs and units (interpretation checklist)

Use this when the user asks “what does this mean?” for a WEPPcloud metric, chart, or table.

## Always clarify

- Spatial scope: hillslope / channel / outlet / whole watershed.
- Time basis: event, annual, average annual, water year.
- Units: mm vs volume; kg/ha vs tonnes; per-area normalization.

## Common interpretation pitfalls

- Comparing totals across different watershed areas without normalizing.
- Comparing “average annual” against a single extreme event.
- Mixing outlet delivery (what leaves the watershed) with hillslope erosion (what detaches on slopes).
