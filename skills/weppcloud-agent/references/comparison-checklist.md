# Scenario comparison checklist

Use this when the user wants “compare these WEPPcloud runs” and you need to keep the comparison defensible.

## Inputs to record (per scenario)

- Run link/ID + scenario name
- Area (and any subarea definitions)
- Climate dataset + period
- Land use / management / treatment assumptions
- Disturbance assumptions (if any)

## Outputs to compare (recommended)

- Outlet delivery metrics (runoff + sediment)
- Water balance totals/ratios
- Event extremes (peak flow / largest events) when relevant

## How to present results

- Start with a small normalized table (per-area and consistent time basis).
- Add 2–3 key charts only after the table establishes the headline differences.
